This is a Masterpoint's reusable and sharable collection of Terraform Root Modules (Components). Each Component is a set of Terraform modules, resources, data sources and local expressions that represent an higher abstraction layer of infrastructure comparing to an average community child module. It can be easily integrated into the architecture and removed if needed.

It's Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).
